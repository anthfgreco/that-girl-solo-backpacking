Reasons to avoid bringing a luggage on your next trip:

1. You will save money on flight tickets-- bringing a carry-on is typically free-of-charge, or significantly cheaper than checking a carry-on.
2. You will not have to wait around and waste time waiting for luggage offload. You can immediately grab your belongings and save 30 minutes-an hour and begin heading to your accommodation.
3. You will have access to all your belongings on flights.
4. It will restrict your space, which means that working towards the solo travel minimalism life is much easier when it simply cannot fit!
5. Hostels often have small/limited storage space. Hostels will often offer those with a larger luggage additional security space, which is often available for an added fee. Not to mention, these storage rooms are never located near your room!
6. Rolling a luggage through the cobblestoned streets of Czech Republic, or the earthy streets of Vietnam is not a pleasant experience.
7. If you are moving around, you'll be utilizing a series of transportation, from trains to buses to boats. It only becomes simpler when your belongings are easy to carry around!

Cons:

1. The overhead storage is typically over-filled and airlines will likely have to check a portion of the overhead luggage.
2. You will be restricted in space.
3. You will have to follow liquid and other storage requirements and limitations.
4. You will have to walk around the airport with all of your belongings for the duration of your waiting time.
5. You likely won't have all that much room for shopping, or souvenir purchases while abroad.
