So you're thinking about solo travelling?

My solo travels have involved a combination of group-guided solo travel and trips where I've hopped on a plane and wandered blindly into a new country.

Both options have their benefits and it really comes down to the overall balance YOU are trying to achieve in your travelling and the many factors involved (safety, finances, freedom, convenience, etc).

## The Guided Tours Option:

The first solo trip I participated in was through a guided solo-backpacker tour company, called Backpacking Tours, which was formerly known as Backpacking Thailand. The second one I participated in was 3-years later through popular Australian company, Intrepid Travel, which explored Vietnam and Cambodia.

The smaller companies, like Backpacking Tours will have less tours running, with less options. This company runs once a month to about 6-destinations, for the allocated time.

A larger company like Intrepid runs dozens on dozens of trips, monthly, with destinations all over the world, catered to different preferences, such as cycling, or food cultures and are available in various durations, from 8 days to 31 days and everything in between, as an example.

Pros:

- This is an incredible option for first-time solo travelers, who may be nervous. Through this experience, you will be exposed to hostels
- You will be visiting places and participating in activities that wouldnâ€™t have otherwise peaked your interest enough to give them a try on your own, or make the arrangements to get there. Over the years, this has challenged me, motivated me, inspired me and more often than not, I am pleasantly surprised and happy to have participated.
- You will be led by a local guide, who is familiar with the language and the culture. The guide is a great resource in ordering food, translating, offering support, suggestions, etc.
- You will feel much safer, as you will be with the same guide and group of tourists along the way, which makes for stronger bonds and an increased comfort level.
- Your local guide will be your go-to and is a valuable resource to have in a foreign country. They will be able to take you to more local spots and experiences off the tourist path, which gives you a more authentic experience.
- All accommodation, transportation and many of the activities are pre-planned. If they aren't, they'll be outlined-- but these are usually typical benefits of a group trip! This is super convenient as most times, the guide will announce your next-day plans before bed and you just have to wake up and be there! They will deal with the rest!
- A great option if you are on a time-restriction to plan your trip, or if you decide to go on a whim!

Cons:

- You are on a schedule, although these groups do typically allocate plenty of free time.
- The majority of your time will be spent in a group setting. Finding time to have your own space/alone time may be limited.
- You will be with the same group of people for the duration of your time. You won't meet as many people along the way, as you'll be in a group setting, but the bond with each other will be a great one.
- You are restricted to the cities/countries/activities which are planned, or offered to you.
- Ensure you research the group dynamic in advance! Many companies offer under 30 trips to ensure for a great bonding experience. But otherwise, you may have a large age gap in your groups!
- Group trips are significantly (even drastically) more expensive than if you had done the same trip solo-- especially those in and around SE Asia!

## The Solo Option:

Pros

- It is scary and challenging and in turn, liberating to acknowledge what you are capable of.
- You will be able to spend your time in the ways YOU choose-- you can focus on what is important to you and the personalized experience that you're looking for!
- You are in the driver's seat of your destiny-- You make the decisions of where to stay, where to visit, what to see, what to do, what to eat!
- The entire experience is rewarding-- you'll learn how to be a better traveler in how you choose to deal with the situations being handed to you!

Cons

- Things will go wrong. You'll be dealing with a lot, planning a lot and managing a lot. Unless you're an expert, things will go wrong and they might discourage you.
- The planning aspect can be significantly more stressful + time consuming.
- You'll have to navigate everything important-- transportation, food, culture, language, accommodation, finding things to do, maps and navigation, etc.
- You'll spend a good chunk of time on your trip coordinating your travel life.

Remember, at the end of the day, only you can make the best decision for you. Chances are, your first solo trip won't be your last, so see how your first one goes and try it again! Every trip, I learn another piece of valuable information to make me a better solo traveler for next time.
