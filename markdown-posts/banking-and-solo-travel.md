Prior to deciding to run free and disappearing to the other side of the world, I had been a banker for seven years. Through that time, I learned a lot of skills to benefit me in the day-to-day. Mostly, I had been grateful that I had learned everything there was to know about a mortgage for when would eventually be the big day.

Little did I know, banking would help me chase a whole other dream and do it as money-safe as I could.

There was a point in Vietnam, where my cards weren’t allowing me to withdraw any money from my accounts. When I called into the bank, they had said that nothing was wrong and that my account looked fine. I still don’t know what the issue was. But I had tried five ATMs that morning. There was a point where my tour guide had our tour bus go out of its way to go to an area by the mall where there were 4 ATMs in a line and none of them worked. 24-hours later, it was just magically fixed. But I borrowed money from my new friends, I owed money to my tour guide. And here’s why I didn’t panic. Even though not all of this worked in the moment, it would have for various circumstances and eventually, something here would have fixed my problem.

Here's some things my experiences in banking taught me and some options you have to protect yourself:

- Get a double debit card – keep them both open. ATMs will often eat your cards and if they do while you’re abroad, you’re in trouble.
- Try to have at least two VISAS, for the same purpose.
- USD VISA – Many countries accept these cards. If anything comes up in USD, you’re set.
- Try to order a foreign currency order to have at least some cash. You can always find an ATM within a 10-minute walk, but I just liked landing and having a bit of all the currencies, so I didn’t have to freak out.
- Ask your bank to add comments to your profile – a lot of banks don’t require this anymore, but every bank employee is able to access these notes on your file, so if something does go wrong, you have a back-up.
- Set up a POA – A power-of-attorney allows someone to act on your behalf, so long as you are well and living. I had my bank set up documents with my mother—which came in handy because in Spain, I got a notification that my cards were blocked. My mom was able to call and sort it out for me from abroad (because I did not have calling service, I had a virtual sim card). Turns out my cards got blocked because I bought an $80 ticket to a flamenco show in Madrid.
- Carry a few hundred dollars of cash in your own currency – If anything goes wrong, there are currency exchange places for emergencies.
- Have a travel VISA. I currently have the following cards from TD Canada Trust: The First Class Travel Infinite and the Aeroplan. Both of these cards give me access to medical insurance, trip cancellation and baggage insurance. There are differences between them, but in addition, there is also hotel burglary insurance, item warranty, etc.
- I haven't ever taken the liberty of exploring my foreign currency options, but I have read not to exchange foreign currency at an airport. I have also heard that it is cheaper to purchase that currency in the country, rather than at an exchange vendor back home.
- Unlike in Canada, you may have to physically provide your card to vendors abroad, where they may take it away to process payment elsewhere. This is a security risk you can't entirely avoid. Make sure to read up on your bank's fraud policies -- with the cards I have and the bank I bank with, I am 100% covered for any fraudulent purchases or transactions that occur on my card.
