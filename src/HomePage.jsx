  Three years ago, my life felt static. I was stuck in a job I was over-qualified for, making a crappy salary. The upside was that I had an incredible boss who let me disappear to the other side of the world on a whim when I couldnâ€™t figure out what came next and needed some *inspiration*.

  Fast forward, three years later, I celebrated my 27th birthday after spending the year backpacking Europe and seeing fifteen different countries in the span of three months. A few days after that birthday, I hopped back onto a plane to backpack southeast Asia with a tour group I fell in love with and a boy, who later paid for my flight over to his hometown in Australia to explore where the road may have taken us. I had been at the company I was working for as a banker for the last almost-seven years and had just completed the contract of the management position I had dreamed of, back when things felt static years ago.
  
  The thing is, once you achieve your goals and your dreams, life tends to feel static again.
  
  The only place I knew I belonged, was abroad.
  
  Thanks for stopping by to read about my journey.
  
  I hope through this, you may feel inspired to chase your dreams, too.
  
  Lots of love,
  
  That girl solo backpacking.
